# 4. World

The world has a fixed size. It is divided in:

## 4.1. Forest

The forest provides basic resources for your townsmen such as wood, meat, medicines, firewood, ... Those resources are available to be gathered and renew themselves automatically.

However, every resource requires certain forest size to grow. For example, wood and firewood require very little space, but animals (meat) and medicine require huge terrain.

### 4.1.1. How-to regenerate the forest

Every time you or your villagers cut down a tree, a forest tile is converted into a wasteland tile. The wasteland tile can be used to build a building, but most of the time you will want to regenerate the forest tile.

The foresters are special villagers that take care of the forest for you. They plant trees in the empty wasteland tiles so they can grow back.

## 4.2. Wasteland

Empty space available to build, it also can be used to regenerate the forest.

## 4.3. Buildings
